FOR INSTANCE, IF THE JACK OF CLUBS COMES BETWEEN THE FOUR AND THE TEN OF
DIAMONDS, AND THE FOLLOWING CARD HAPPENS TO BE THE DEUCE OF SPADES, IT
MEANS THAT THE NEXT OFFER OF MARRIAGE SHOULD BE ACCEPTED.]

[Illustration: A WORD TO THE WISE.

HAVE A BOOK IN CASE YOU ARE BORED.]

[Illustration: _Manager_: UNLESS YOU BRACE UP I’LL HAVE TO BREAK OUR
CONTRACT.

“DON’T SAY THAT! I HAVE A CHILD AND TWO HUSBANDS TO SUPPORT.”]

[Illustration: THE SUPPER.

SHALL IT BE WHAT SHE IS ACCUSTOMED TO OR THE BEST HE CAN AFFORD?]

[Illustration: _Enthusiastic Young Miss_: TO THINK OF YOUR BEING A REAL
LITERARY MAN! I DO SO LONG TO KNOW HOW YOU WRITE THINGS. CANT YOU
EXPLAIN IT?

_Venerable Hack_: IT IS THE SIMPLEST THING. YOU HAVE A MIND SUITABLY
PREPARED. YOU GET AN IDEA. THE IDEA BEING INTRODUCED INTO THE MIND
CAUSES FERMENTATION, DURING WHICH A SCUM RISES TO THE TOP AND IS
CAREFULLY REMOVED, LEAVING A RESIDUE OF CLEAR THOUGHT. THIS YOU BOTTLE
UP FOR YOUR OWN USE. THE SCUM YOU SELL TO A PUBLISHER.]

UP THE PAST, WHY, LET’S NOT DIG UP THE FUTURE EITHER.”]

[Illustration: WARNING TO NOBLEMEN.

TREAT YOUR AMERICAN WIFE WITH KINDNESS.]

[Illustration: ADVICE TO BEGINNERS.

KEEP CLOSE TO NATURE.]

[Illustration: “HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL IN THE HUMAN BREAST; MAN NEVER IS,
BUT ALWAYS TO BE BLESSED.”]

[Illustration: “MIND HIS KISSING YOU? NO, NOT IF YOU DON’T. IT SHOWS
AFFECTION, AS ONE’S NEPHEWS SHOULD BE AFFECTIONATE. BUT IF I WERE
DISPOSED TO BE CRITICAL, I SHOULD SAY THAT GROWN-UP NEPHEWS WHO KISS
THEIR AUNTS BY MARRIAGE SHOULD KISS THEM SOMEWHAT MORE DEFERENTIALLY AND
PERFUNCTORILY--MORE LIKE A TIMID FLY WHO APPROACHES A PIECE OF
ROCK-CANDY, AND NOT QUITE SO MUCH LIKE A HUNGRY ORPHAN TURNED LOOSE IN A
BAKE-SHOP. I’D TELL HIS MOTHER, AMELIA, IF I WERE YOU. HE NEEDS
TRAINING.”]

[Illustration: ADVICE TO CADDIES.

YOU WILL SAVE TIME BY KEEPING YOUR EYE ON THE BALL, NOT ON THE PLAYER.]

“I’M UNABLE TO SAY. I WASN’T ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR HUSBAND.”]

[Illustration: SUMMER AND WINTER.

BOTH SIDES OF IT.]

[Illustration]

[Illustration: BIG GAME.]

[Illustration: ECONOMY.

_She musing_: IT SEEMS A PITY TO SPEND TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS TO HAVE A
GOWN MADE OVER, WHEN I CAN GET A NEW ONE FOR TWO HUNDRED.]

[Illustration: “DON’T UNDERVALUE LOVE, DEAR CHILD. LOVE IN A FLAT-A
_good_ FLAT--ON TWENTY, YES, EVEN ON FIFTY-THOUSAND A YEAR, MAY EASILY
BE PREFERABLE TO RICHES WITHOUT TRUE AFFECTION.”]

[Illustration: WASTING TIME.]

[Illustration: THE RACE IS NOT ALWAYS TO THE BEAUTIFUL.]

[Illustration: IN “SOCIETY.”

DO WE SEE SO MUCH OF OLD AGE AND YOUTH BECAUSE THE MIDDLE-AGED MEN HAVE
SOMETHING BETTER TO DO?]

[Illustration: A CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE.

_She_: IT TELLS HERE OF A MAN IN CHICAGO WHO HASN’T SPOKEN TO HIS WIFE
IN FIFTEEN YEARS.

“PERHAPS HE IS WAITING FOR A CHANCE.”]

[Illustration: _She_: WHY SUCH A HURRY TO MARRY, DICK? WE’VE ONLY BEEN
ENGAGED THREE MONTHS. “YES; I KNOW; BUT i AM AFRAID YOU WILL GET TIRED
OF ME.”]

[Illustration: A NORTHEASTER.

SOME LOOK WELL IN IT.]

DAUGHTER MARRIED.

_The Brute_: ER--WHAT OTHER INDUCEMENTS DO YOU OFFER?]

[Illustration: THE STOUT GENTLEMAN HOPED HE HAD FOUND A SECLUDED SPOT
FOR THE HONEYMOON.]

[Illustration: “COME ALONG, MARTIN, LET’S GO TO THE HANGING.”

“HANGIN’? HANGIN’? WHO’S GOIN’ TO BE HANGED?”

“JIM SANDERS. COME ALONG.”

“NO; THANKS. HE’S NO FRIEND O’ MINE.”]

[Illustration: “I SEE THE GOVERNOR COMMENDS WAR AS A MEANS OF KEEPING
ALIVE ‘THE GREAT FIGHTING VIRTUES,’ AND, OF COURSE, WAR _is_ A GOOD
THING WHILE IT LASTS. BUT, AFTER ALL, CHARLES, DO YOU FEEL THAT WAR IS
TRULY PROFITABLE? AS FOR ME, UNATHLETIC AS I AM, AND NEAR-SIGHTED, I
COULD HARDLY DO EXCELLENT WORK IN WAR. I MIGHT BRAIN A CHILD OR TWO, AND
MAYBE SHOOT SOME WOMEN, BUT I OWN I DON’T FIND THE IDEA WHOLLY ENGAGING,
AND IN THE SPRING MONTHS I CAN HARDEN MY HEART MORE AGREEABLY BY RIDING
A BICYCLE IN THE AFTERNOON DOWN FIFTH AVENUE. IT’S A GOOD HAZARD ALL THE
WAY, AND THERE’S THIS ADVANTAGE ABOUT IT, THAT YOU DON’T CATCH FEVERS,
AND, IF YOU’RE NOT KILLED, YOU HAVE YOUR HEALTH.”]

[Illustration: HIS VACATION OVER.]

[Illustration: FINANCIAL PREDICAMENT.

THIS NOBLEMAN CANNOT RECALL WHICH HEIRESS ACCEPTED HIM THE NIGHT

“ISN’T YOUR MOTHER WORRIED BY CAPTAIN SHORTHOUSE’S ATTENTIONS TO YOU?”

“OH, NO; SINCE I GAVE JACK HIS FREEDOM AFTER THE HIDE TRUST SLUMP, MAMMA
SAYS I’M A REAL MOTHER MYSELF, AND NOW SHE NEVER WORRIES.”]

[Illustration: “I THOUGHT I HEARD MR. SQUEESICKS KISSING YOU LAST NIGHT,
ETHEL. I HOPE YOU DID NOT ENCOURAGE HIM.”

“I DIDN’T NEED TO.”]

[Illustration: MATRIMONIAL MISFITS.

THE WOMAN WHO MARRIES A CLUB MAN.]

[Illustration: HIS BEGINNING.

“I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH ME.”

“NEITHER HAD I, UNTIL I PROPOSED AND YOU REJECTED ME.”]

[Illustration:

_Mrs. Dimpleton_: I AM GOING TO SEE THE DOCTOR TO-DAY, AND I KNOW HE
WILL INSIST UPON MY GOING ABROAD THIS SUMMER.

_Dimpleton_: NO, HE WONT. I MET HIM YESTERDAY AND TOLD HIM IF HE SENT
YOU ABROAD I COULDN’T PAY HIS BILL.]

[Illustration: MONDAY MORNING.]

[Illustration: _She_: IF I LET YOU KISS ME THIS ONCE, WILL YOU PROMISE
NEVER TO ASK ME AGAIN?

_He_: CERTAINLY, DEAR, IF YOU CONSIDER IT UNNECESSARY.]

[Illustration: THE SPINSTER’S REVERY.

WHAT THE DAY RECALLS.]

[Illustration: A RECEIPT FOR KISSES.

TO ONE PIECE OF DARK PIAZZA ADD A LITTLE MOONLIGHT--TAKE FOR GRANTED TWO
PEOPLE. PRESS IN TWO STRONG ONES A SMALL, SOFT HAND. SIFT LIGHTLY TWO
OUNCES OF ATTRACTION, ONE OF ROMANCE; ADD A LARGE MEASURE OF FOLLY; STIR
IN A FLOATING RUFFLE AND ONE OR TWO WHISPERS. DISSOLVE HALF A DOZEN
GLANCES IN A WELL OF SILENCE; DUST IN A SMALL QUANTITY OF HESITATION,
ONE OUNCE OF RESISTANCE, TWO OF YIELDING; PLACE THE KISSES ON A FLUSHED
CHEEK OR TWO LIPS; FLAVOR WITH A SLIGHT SCREAM, AND SET ASIDE TO COOL.
THIS WILL SUCCEED IN ANY CLIMATE, IF DIRECTIONS ARE CAREFULLY
FOLLOWED.]

[Illustration: “I OFTEN WONDER WHY YOU DON’T GET MARRIED.”

“BECAUSE I’M TOO FOND OF MEN’S SOCIETY.”]

[Illustration: THE CABLE CAR.]

[Illustration: THE PROPER EDUCATION.

_Daughter_ (_home from a seminary_): WE NO SOONER LEARN A LITTLE ABOUT
ONE SUBJECT. MAMMA. THAN WE STOP AND TURN TO ANOTHER.

“YOU MUST REMEMBER, DEAR, THAT I AM FITTING YOU TO ENTER SOCIETY.”]

[Illustration: _Charles_ (_loquitur_): IT IS QUITE TRUE, FATHER, AS YOU
SAY, THAT OUR RELIGIOUS DUTIES ARE OF SIGNAL MOMENT. BUT THEY ARE OFTEN
PERPLEXING, AND SOME OF THEM OFTEN SEEM TO ME TO CONFLICT WITH OTHERS.
PERHAPS YOU AND I COULD COVER THE GROUND BETTER IF WE USED SOME
JUDICIOUS PLAN OF CO-OPERATION. SUPPOSE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT YOU OBEY THE
INJUNCTION “GIVE TO HIM THAT ASKETH,” AND LEAVE ME TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR
EFFORTS BY TAKING NO THOUGHT FOR THE MORROW.]

[Illustration: NO WONDER THE SEA SERPENT FREQUENTS OUR COAST.]

[Illustration: _The Nobleman_: EVERY MAN HAS HIS PRICE, YOU KNOW.

“OH, THIS IS SO SUDDEN!”]

[Illustration: AWFUL PREDICAMENT.

THE TRIPLETS FIND THEY ARE ALL ENGAGED TO THE SAME MAN.]

HE DOUBTED IT.

_Mrs. Henrypeck_: YOU HAVE BEEN VERY AGGRAVATING AT TIMES, AND WE HAVE
NOT ALWAYS GOT ALONG VERY WELL TOGETHER; BUT STILL, IF I HAD TO DO IT
OVER AGAIN, I’D MARRY YOU JUST THE SAME.

_MR. H._ (_under his breath_): I’M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT.
